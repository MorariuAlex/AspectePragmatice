Guides taken from Angular Style Guide:
	SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE
		-Do define one thing, such as a service or component, per file : all files
		-Consider limiting files to 400 lines of code : all files
 
		-Do define small functions 
		-Consider limiting to no more than 75 lines
		-Examples : login() -> login.component.ts

 
NAMING CONVENTIONS
 
	Naming conventions are hugely important to maintainability and readability

	Do use consistent type names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then its type. A recommended pattern is feature.type.ts.
	dashboard.component.ts ; profile.component.ts ; register.component.ts

	Do use dashes to separate words in the descriptive name.
	job-posting.service.ts ; 

	Do use consistent names for all assets named after what they represent.
	arrowNext.png ; loginBackground.png ; homepageWallpaper.png

	Do use upper camel case for class names.
	Class JobPostingComponent ; Class HomepageComponent

	Do match the name of the symbol to the name of the file.
	All files from Components

	Do append the symbol name with the conventional suffix (such as Component, Directive, Module, Pipe, or Service) for a thing of that type.
	Do give the filename the conventional suffix (such as .component.ts, .directive.ts, .module.ts, .pipe.ts, or .service.ts) for a file of that type.
	All the above examples
 
 
COMPONENT SELECTORS:
	Do use dashed-case or kebab-case for naming the element selectors of components.
	job-posting.service.ts ; dashboard-employer.service.ts ; dashboard-employee.service.ts
